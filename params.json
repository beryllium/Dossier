Eventually, the hope is to integrate this tool into workflows so that companies can automate the whitelisting (and subsequent pruning/ageing/removal) of dynamic IP addresses.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nDossier is being developed by @beryllium as a way to improve efficiency when dealing with AWS, and also as a Python learning experience.","tagline":"A management tool for Amazon EC2 security groups"}
